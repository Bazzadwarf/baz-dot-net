# Make Things For Your Friends

For me, the process of making things has almost always been in pursuit of some other goal: finishing projects for a course, making things to go on a portfolio when looking for work, or making things to be used at work. Over the last few years, every time I have embarked on making something, it has been in pursuit of a goal set for me by someone else, and while these projects can be gratifying to complete, there have been periods when the joy in the process of creation has been lost.

I wouldn't describe myself as ever having burnout, but there have definitely been periods when the last thing I wanted to do was sit at a computer and force myself to make something I did not want to make. It used to weigh on me that the things I was making were not even appreciated by the people they were intended for. Knowing that nobody was getting any joy out of what I created made the whole process feel pointless.

Discord is a gaming-focused instant messenger/social media platform that we had been using for some years. Much like any online chat room, people inevitably make bots to help automate certain actions. So why not make our own bot that can do everything we need it to?

While I had little experience using the technologies required to make a Discord bot, there is a wide selection of frameworks available that help you get up and running with minimal headaches. After some research, I decided to give it a go and dive into using discord.js to see if I could get anything up and running.

After toiling away for a week, the first version of what would become [The Ochulus](sauce.wednesday.pizza/baz/theochulus) was complete. While this initial version was basic in functionality, people other than myself were able to use it, and over the next few days I started getting requests for extra features.

As the bot started to get more and more use, I found myself spending increasing amounts of time adding new features to the bot. Some of these were requests by other people; some I added purely because I thought people would enjoy them. What started out as a small experiment has turned into a project that is used on a daily basis by the people close to me.

We are currently living through a time when the act of creation has been commercialized and twisted to a point where the simple act of making anything is distorted into thinking about how to appeal to a black-box algorithm that may decide to show whatever you have made to whoever it deems appropriate. One argument is that because of this, the only way out is to simply not engage at all, and while effective, that cuts off the human feedback that can be vital for sticking with a project and taking it beyond what you initially intended.

My recommendation is this: make things for yourself that you can show off to the people close to you. For almost every positive relationship you have, the person on the other side is likely to be interested in the things you do and are passionate about. If you have things you have created, show them to your friends. If these are things they can interact with, let them interact with them. Enjoy the experience of letting others enjoy the things you enjoy doing.

The internet can be a lonely place. Don't wait for strangers to stumble across you; let the people you know enjoy it instead.

In a way, this is a promise to myself: to spend more time making the things I want to make and to let my friends enjoy them as well.
